                    Let's pause to add our safety eyes. I placed mine between the 11th and 12th rows, with 8 stitches in between.
                                        
                    Using a tapestry needle and the yarn color of your choice, stitch on a cute little nose. I made a triangle shape between
                    the eyes.
                                        
                    And add some stuffing.

                    Using a tapestry needle and the long tail, stitch the remaining opening closed and attach to the body.

                    <b>Bunny Ears:</b>
                    Round 1: In a magic circle, SC 6, pull tight (6 stitches)

                    Slip stitch, chain 1, tie off with a long tail.

                    We won't be adding any stuffing to the ears so they'll sit relatively flat.
                                        
                    To shape the ear, fold the bottom inward (sort of like a taco). Using a tapestry needle and the long tail, stitch the
                    fold together.
                    
                    Again using the long tail and a tapestry needle, attach the ears to the head.

                        Fasten off leaving a long tail for sewing.

                       <b>Assembling:</b>
                        â€¢ Sew the ears from R4 to R8.
                        â€¢ Attach the forelegs slantingly from R14 to R15.
                        â€¢ Attach the hind legs slanting inward from R20 to R21.
                        Using 2 or 3 strands of embroidery thread, make an inverted 'v' shape for the mouth
                        â€¢ Sew the whiskers one stitch away from the eyes.
                        â€¢ Using Tapestry needle and black yarn, make 3 long stripes from top of the head to R7 at the
                        center.
                        â€¢ Similarly make 2 more stripes at the sides, 2 stitches away from the center stripe.
                        â€¢ Add in 2 side stripes at R16 and another at R18 on both sides of the body.
                        â€¢ Sew 2 back stripes at R10 and another at R12 at the back of the body.
                        Finally attach the tail slantingly from R18 to R19 at the back.

                    <b>Putting the Pieces Together</b>
                    Before I start sewing my amigurumi otter together, I first use pins to place each piece where I think it should go.
                    I remove the pins from my amigurumi as I sew. I placed the ears on rows 4 and 5 from the top of the head. I placed the
                    arms on rows 12 and 13 of the body. I placed the legs on rows 18 and 19 of the body. Lastly, I placed the kelp on
                    top of the body between the arms and legs, so that it looks like the otter is holding it. See the below photos for an
                    example.
                    
                    <b>Placement of the ears, arms, and legs on the otterâ€™s body.</b>
                    
                    Place the kelp on top of the otterâ€™s body, between the arms and legs.
                    Once you are comfortable with the placement of the pieces, use your yarn needle to sew them onto the body.
                    
                    Next, it is time to cut and glue on the felt details for the otterâ€™s face. Using your felt and scissors, cut a small
                    black oval for the nose, a thin black rectangle for the mouth, and two pink circles for the cheeks.
                    
                    Cut a small black oval for the nose, a thin black rectangle for the mouth, and two pink circles for the cheeks.
                    Place the felt details where you would like them and glue them on using your hot glue gun. I placed my cheeks
                    diagonally
                    below the otterâ€™s eyes. I placed the nose and mouth centered between the otterâ€™s eyes. See the below photo as an
                    example.

                    R14-22: sc in each st [18]

                    The beginning of the round should now be more heavily on the right side (left side if you're left handed). To get back
                    to the middle, we are going to do an extra sc3 and start R23 in the next st. SEE PIC 1. Adjust these stitches so that
                    your hook is in the middle of your dino. This step is IMPORTANT as it will prevent the dino from turning out uneven.
                    After the extra stitches, you'll now start R23.
                    
                    R23: sc6, Inc6, sc6 [24]

                    **TIP: you may experience rippling, but it'll even out by R38**

                    Continue stuffing while flattening the dino's belly on a flat surface. At this point, you'll notice the beginning of the
                    round will begin to shift once again. For me, it took 2 extra sts to get back to the middle but adjust these stitches as
                    needed to get back to the middle. Start R42 after completing the extra stitches.

                    R42-43: sc in each st [30]

                    Finish stuffing, close, and weave in the tail. Make sure to flatten the bottom of the body on a flat surface to esnure
                    the perfect dino body shape!

                    Fasten off with a long tail for sewing. Stuff before sewing onto the dino body between R25-28.Try to flatten your dino
                    body on the bottom side and sew the leg so it's flush with the underside of the body to make it look like he's
                    laying down with his legs out.
